\chapter{Guidelines on format and content} \label{ch-1}

You will find the most recent version of the guidelines here: \url{https://groups.oist.jp/grad/academic-program-policies}.

Many of the requirements such as page size, fonts, etc are built-in into this template.

You will find in \texttt{Preamble/mydefinitions.tex} some values that you need to modify to generate some pages like the front page or the abstract.

For the bibliography, we recommend using BibTeX or BibLaTeX and through the file \texttt{Preamble/Thesis\_bibliography.bib} and referencing citations like this \cite{Lee98, Muc10, Kra27}.
